# three-wheel-cipher
This python script will encode messages similarly to how a Caesar cipher would.

It uses 3 numbers (the key) to set the initial position of the wheels. As the message is encrypted one wheel will rotate, after a full rotation the next wheel will move by one step. Having the correct key will mean the message is able to be decrypted.

The program is somewhat inspired by how the Enigma machine works.

To run you will need python 3 and the Tkinter module.
